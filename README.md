YAML Questions:
- What is required for a Model when there is no required argument? (what is the schema for the fields? ie ListLibrary)

- How to differentiate GET vs POST (does a POST also "GET" information? so use it only when database changes need too occur?)

- Can we "tag:" both participant and admin in the same Model?


DB Questions:
- User definitions in the database? (where/how are user types defined?)
